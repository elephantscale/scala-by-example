# ScalaByExample, Chapter 2

## QuickSort1.scala

Implements code as described, nothing added. Teaches you Scala syntax but not its best practices.
It does teach the recursive call in the function. Moreover, this call is placed at the end of the code body - 
we will be talking about it later.

## QuickSort2.scala

Same as QuickSort1 but in functional style.
